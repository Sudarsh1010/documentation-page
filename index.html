                    As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's <br>
                    not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, <br>
                    React Native can be used to build mobile applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often <br>
                    discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web <br>
                    development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we’re working with that colloquial <br>
                    understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this <br>
                    through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user <br>
                    interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away <br>
                    much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.

                <p>
                    Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code <br>
                    conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt <br>
                    React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an <br>
                    app's entire user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to "drop into" an application as <br>
                    a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable when you build your entire <br>
                    app with React.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing interfaces with JSX, <br>
                    require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code on it run slowly, so <br>
                    developers often set up such tooling with a build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, <br>
                    but it can be learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the entire user interface of an <br>
                    application, using tooling provided by Facebook’s own create-react-app tool.

            <header>How does React use JavaScript?</header>

            <article>
                <p>
                    React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its biggest departure from JavaScript <br>
                    comes with the use of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's syntax so that HTML-like code can live <br>
                    alongside it. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    const heading = &lt;h1&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1&gt;;
                </code>
                <p>
                    This heading constant is known as a JSX expression. React can use it to render that &lt;h1&gt; tag in our app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose we wanted to wrap our heading in a &lt;header&gt; tag, for semantic reasons? The JSX approach <br>
                    allows us to nest our elements within each other, just like we do with HTML:
                </p>
                <code>
                    const header = ( <br>
                    &emsp;&lt;header> <br>
                    &emsp; &emsp; &lt;h1>Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1> <br>
                    &emsp;&lt;/header> <br>
                    );
                </code>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <b>Note:</b> The parentheses in the previous snippet aren't unique to JSX, and don’t have any effect on your <br>
                        application. They're a signal to you (and your computer) that the multiple lines of code inside are part of the <br>
                        same expression. You could just as well write the header expression like this: 
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        const header = &lt;header> <br>
                        &emsp;&lt;h1>Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1> <br>
                        &lt;/header> 
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        However, this looks kind of awkward, because the &lt;header> tag that starts the expression is not indented <br>
                        to the same position as its corresponding closing tag
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Of course, your browser can't read JSX without help. When compiled (using a tool like Babel or Parcel), <br>
                    our header expression would look like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    const header = React.createElement("header", null, <br>
                    &emsp;React.createElement("h1", null, "Mozilla Developer Network") <br>
                    );
                </code>
                <p>
                    It's possible to skip the compilation step and use React.createElement() to write your UI yourself. <br>
                    In doing this, however, you lose the declarative benefit of JSX, and your code becomes harder to read. <br>
                    Compilation is an extra step in the development process, but many developers in the React community <br>
                    think that the readability of JSX is worthwhile. Plus, popular tooling makes the JSX-to-JavaScript <br>
                    compilation part of its setup process. You don't have to configure compilation yourself unless you want to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because JSX is a blend of HTML and JavaScript, some developers find it intuitive. Others say that its <br>
                    blended nature makes it confusing. Once you're comfortable with it, however, it will allow you to build user <br>
                    interfaces more quickly and intuitively, and allow others to better understand your codebase at a glance.
                </p>

                    There are many ways to use React, but we're going to use the command-line interface (CLI) tool create- <br>
                    react-app, as mentioned earlier, which expedites the process of developing a React application by installing <br>
                    some packages and creating some files for you, handling the tooling described above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's possible to add React to a website without create-react-app by copying some &lt;script> elements <br>
                    into an HTML file, but the create-react-app CLI is a common starting point for React applications. Using it <br>
                    will allow you to spend more time building your app, and less time fussing with setup.
                </p>
                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to use create-react-app, you need to have Node.js installed. It's recommended that you use the <br>
                    long-term support (LTS) version. Node includes npm (the node <br>
                    package manager), and npx (the node package runner).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may also use the Yarn package manager as an alternative, but we'll assume you are using npm in this <br>
                    set of tutorials. See Package management basics for more information on npm and yarn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to give you parity with Unix/macOS terminal <br>
                    in order to use the terminal commands mentioned in this tutorial. Gitbash (which comes as part of the <br>
                    git for Windows toolset) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) are both suitable. See Command <br>
                    line crash course for more information on these, and on terminal commands in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also bear in mind that React and ReactDOM produce apps that only work on a fairly modern set of <br>
                    browsers — IE9+ by way of some polyfills. It is recommended that you use a modern browser like Firefox, <br>
                    Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Chrome when working through these tutorials.
                </p>

                <p>
                    create-react-app takes one argument: the name you'd like to give your app. create-react-app uses this <br>
                    name to make a new directory, then creates the necessary files inside it. Make sure you cd to the place <br>
                    you'd like your app to live on your hard drive, then run the following in your terminal:
                </p>
                <code>npx create-react-app moz-todo-react</code>
                <p>
                    This creates a moz-todo-react directory, and does several things inside it: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Installs some npm packages essential to the functionality of the app.</li>
                    <li>Writes scripts for starting and serving the application.</li>
                    <li>Creates a structure of files and directories that define the basic app architecture.</li>
                    <li>Initializes the directory as a git repository, if you have git installed on your computer.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="code-desc">
                    <p>
                        <b>Note:</b> if you have the yarn package manager installed, create-react-app will default to using it instead of npm. <br>
                        If you have both package managers installed and explicitly want to use NPM, you can add the flag <br>
                        --use-npm when you run create-react-app:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        npx create-react-app moz-todo-react --use-npm
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    create-react-app will display a number of messages in your terminal while it works; this is normal! <br>
                    This might take a few minutes, so now might be a good time to go make a cup of tea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the process is complete, cd into the moz-todo-react directory and run the command npm start. <br>
                    The scripts installed by create-react-app will start being served at a local server at localhost:3000, and open <br>
                    the app in a new browser tab. Your browser will display something like this:

                    The src directory is where we'll spend most of our time, as it's where the source code for our application lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The public directory contains files that will be read by your browser while you're developing the <br>
                    app; the most important of these is index.html. React injects your code into this file so that your browser can run <br>
                    it. There's some other markup that helps create-react-app function, so take care not to edit it unless you <br>
                    know what you're doing. You very much should change the text inside the &lt;title> element in this file to <br>
                    reflect the title of your application. Accurate page titles are important for accessibility!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The public directory will also be published when you build and deploy a production version of your app. <br>
                    We won’t cover deployment in this tutorial, but you should be able to use a similar solution to that described <br>
                    in our Deploying our app tutorial.

                    The package.json file contains information about our project that Node.js/npm uses to keep it organized. <br>
                    This file is not unique to React applications; create-react-app merely populates it. You don't need to <br>
                    understand this file at all to complete this tutorial, however, if you'd like to learn more about it, you can read <br>
                    What is the file `package.json`? on NodeJS.org; we also talk about it in our Package <br>
